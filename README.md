# Principle Components Analysis Explained

The report explores the concept and mathematical foundation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) â€” a fundamental linear dimensionality reduction technique in data visualization and machine learning. It presents both theoretical and practical aspects, including the origins and definitions of PCA, approaches by Pearson and Hotelling, key mathematical derivations, and algorithmic implementation using Python on the Iris dataset.
